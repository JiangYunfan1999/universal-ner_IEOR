We expect revenue in 2021 and future years from servicing these customers and adding new customers in the region.\n We typically receive revenue based on the number of active accounts on file rather than transaction volume and therefore the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic slowdown has had a muted impact on our results. Most of our employees in India have been working remotely throughout the pandemic which has impacted our ability to hire and train new employees. We have been able to maintain key functions and business continuity while delivering growth in our professional services revenue; however, the hiring and training constraints could impact future growth in our professional services revenue.\n The infrastructure of our multi customer environment is scalable for the future. A significant portion of our expense is related to personnel, including more than 500 employees located in India and Romania. In 2017, we opened a second office in India, located near Mumbai, to enable us to attract the level of talent required for our software development and testing. In October 2020, we opened offices in Dubai, United Arab Emirates and Chennai, India to support CoreCard\u2019s expansion of processing services into new markets in the Asia Pacific, Middle East, Africa and European regions. The new offices include engineering, support and business professionals with significant payments industry experience and experience operating CoreCard\u2019s Processing platforms in the related regions. Our ability to hire and train employees on our processes and software impacts our ability to onboard new customers and deliver professional services for software customizations. In addition, we have certain corporate office expenses associated with being a public company that impact our operating results.\n Our revenue fluctuates from period to period and our results are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods.

The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. We consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and valuation of investments to be critical policies due to the estimation processes involved in each. For a detailed description on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n Revenue Recognition - Product revenue consists of fees from software licenses. Service revenue consists of fees for processing services; professional services for software customization, consulting, and training; reimbursable expenses; and software maintenance and customer support.\n Our software license arrangements generally fall into one of the following four categories:\n\u25cf\nan initial contract with the customer to license certain software modules, to provide services to get the customer live on the software (such as training and customization) and to provide post contract support (\u201cPCS\u201d) for a specified period of time thereafter,\n\u25cf\npurchase of additional licenses for new modules or for tier upgrades for a higher volume of licensed accounts after the initial contract,\n\u25cf\nother optional standalone contracts, usually performed after the customer is live on the software, for services such as new interfaces or custom features requested by the customer, additional training and problem resolution not covered in annual maintenance contracts, or\n\u25cf\ncontracts for certain licensed software products that involve an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees during the contract life.\n At contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service (or bundle of products or services) that is distinct. A performance obligation is distinct if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. To identify our performance obligations, we consider all of the products or services promised in the contract regardless of whether they are explicitly stated or are implied by customary business practices. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control of a product or service to a customer. Our revenue recognition policies for each of the situations described above are discussed below.\n Our software licenses generally have significant stand-alone functionality to the customer upon delivery and are considered to be functional intellectual property.

Upon renewal of the PCS contract by the customer, we recognize revenues ratably on a straight-line basis over the period specified in the PCS contract. All of our software customers purchase software maintenance and support contracts and renew such contracts annually.\n Certain initial software contracts contain specified future service elements for scheduled completion following the implementation, and related recognition, of the initial license. In these instances, after the initial license recognition, where distinct future performance obligations are identified in the contract and we could reliably measure the completion of each identified performance obligation, we have recognized revenue at the time the individual performance obligation was completed.\n Purchases of additional licenses for tier upgrades or additional modules are generally recognized as license revenue in the period in which the purchase is made for perpetual licenses or ratably over the remaining contract term for non-perpetual licenses.\n Services provided under standalone contracts that are optional to the customer and are outside of the scope of the initial contract are single element services contracts.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n Basis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\n Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes organization in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_516", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "The following consolidated financial statements of the Registrant and its subsidiaries are submitted herewith in response to Item 8:\nFinancial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm - Nichols, Cauley & Associates, LLC\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders\u2019 Equity for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nNichols, Cauley & Associates, LLC\n3550 Engineering Drive, Suite 250\nPeachtree Corners, Georgia 30092\n404-214-1301 FAX 404-214-1302\natlanta@nicholscauley.com\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Intelligent Systems Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Intelligent Systems Corporation and Subsidiaries (the \u201cCompany\u201d) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders\u2019 equity, and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \u201cfinancial statements\u201d).

Level 3 valuations incorporate certain assumptions and projections that are not observable in the market and significant professional judgment is needed in determining the fair value assigned to such assets or liabilities.\n In instances where the determination of the fair value measurement is based on inputs from different levels of the fair value hierarchy, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the entire fair value measurement falls is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety.\n Our marketable securities investments are classified within level 1 of the valuation hierarchy.\n The fair value of equity method investments has not been determined as it is impracticable to do so due to the fact that the investee companies are relatively small, early stage private companies for which there is no comparable valuation data available without unreasonable time and expense. The fair value of our cost method investments was determined using Level 3 inputs.\n Revenue Recognition - Product revenue consists of fees from software licenses. Service revenue consists of fees for processing services; professional services for software customization, consulting, training; reimbursable expenses; and software maintenance and customer support.\n Our software license arrangements generally fall into one of the following four categories:\n\u25cf\nan initial contract with the customer to license certain software modules, to provide services to get the customer live on the software (such as training and customization) and to provide post contract support (\u201cPCS\u201d) for a specified period of time thereafter,\n\u25cf\npurchase of additional licenses for new modules or for tier upgrades for a higher volume of licensed accounts,\n\u25cf\nother optional standalone contracts, usually performed after the customer is live on the software, for services such as new interfaces or custom features requested by the customer, additional training and problem resolution not covered in annual maintenance contracts, or\n\u25cf\ncontracts for certain licensed software products that involve an initial fee plus recurring monthly fees during the contract life.\n At contract inception, we assess the products and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a product or service (or bundle of products or services) that is distinct. A performance obligation is distinct if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer.

On January 2, 2020, Defendants submitted a motion to dismiss, and on March 3, 2020, briefing on the motion to dismiss was completed. The motion to dismiss is currently pending. We dispute these claims and intend to defend the matter vigorously.\n On or about February 14, 2020, two purported shareholders, derivatively and on behalf of the Company, filed substantially similar shareholder derivative actions in the Eastern District of New York against certain current and former directors and officers (the \u201cIndividual Defendants\u201d), and the Company as a nominal defendant (together with the Individual Defendants, the \u201cDefendants\u201d). The complaints assert a claim against Messrs. Strange, Moise, Petit, Fuzzell and Chandler for a violation of Section 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act by issuing purportedly misleading statements in the Company\u2019s 2017 and 2018 Proxies. The complaints also assert claims against the Individual Defendants for breaches of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment arising out of, among other things, purportedly undisclosed related party transactions, other relationships, and certain allegations against former director Parker H. Petit in connection with his former position with MiMedx, Inc. and other companies. The relief sought in the complaints includes changes to the Company\u2019s corporate governance procedures, unspecified damages, equitable relief, restitution, and attorney\u2019s fees and costs. On April 20, 2020, the two derivative actions were consolidated and captioned, In re Intelligent Systems Corporation Stockholder Derivative Litigation, Lead Case No. 1:20-cv-00832, in the Eastern District of New York (the \u201cDerivative Matter\u201d). On June 19, 2020, Defendants filed their motion to dismiss, and briefing was subsequently completed."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_801", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "On September 8, 2020, Plaintiffs moved for leave to conduct limited discovery (\u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 Motion for Discovery\u201d).
