KlickZie technology-based business activity\nTautachrome\u2019s KlickZie technology addresses two features of the internet age that create a new need and a new opportunity. The first is the need for a way to trust the pictures and videos you see on the web. Right now the trillions of pictures and frames of video on the web are so easily and often falsified that trustability of internet imagery is essentially zero. For this reason we believe that a universally available, downloadable system that turns the everyday pictures and videos we take from our smartphones into imagery that can be trustable to others seeing it, will have substantial value . We would like to see only two kinds of imagery come to exist on the web: imagery whose trustworthiness everybody can be certain of, and all the rest of the imagery for which the notion of trust is meaningless. The KlickZie system aims to satisfy the requirement of for universal trustability for the ordinary imagery it produces.\n The technology required for trustability also opens the door to a new opportunity.

Legal Proceedings\nUnited States District Court\nOn October 10, 2017, the Company received a letter from the lawyer of Eric L McRae (\u201cMcRae\u201d) a person whose association with the Company was terminated by the Company on June 16, 2017. The letter demanded payment of 850,000,000 unrestricted Tautachrome common shares to forestall his filing a laundry list of complaints in a variety of government agencies including with the US District Court in Kansas with complaints of contract breaches and fraud by silence, with the EEOC with complaints of termination by racial discrimination, with the OSHA with complains of termination for reasons of his being a whistleblower under Sarbanes-Oxley provisions, and with various regulatory agencies with accusations of an unspecified nature.\n On October 12, 2017, McRae filed a complaint, later amended twice, against the Company in the US District Court in Kansas. The amended complaint alleges 1) that the Company breached a written agreement in an alleged employment by failing to pay him 35,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and terminating his association with the Company on June 16, 2017 without proper notice. The complaint goes on to allege 2) that the Company committed fraud by silence for failing to inform him of an intent to receive the benefit of his services while harboring an intent to not compensate him, 3) that the Company breached an unwritten agreement with him to provide him with 185,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and 4) that the Company breached a convertible promissory note by failing and refusing to repay him the principal and accrued interest thereunder. Complaint number 4 is now moot in the belief of the Company since after the lawsuit was filed the Company continued to repay McRae\u2019s convertible promissory note on schedule with interest due until paid in full on October 1, 2018, thus extinguishing the note and making the matter moot. These matters remain before the Court.\n On December 12, 2017, McRae brought the Company before the Kansas Human Rights Commission and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that on June 16, 2017 he was terminated from an alleged employment by the Company on the basis of race and for retaliation, and that the Company discriminated against him in the terms of this alleged employment because of race. The Kansas Human Rights Commission dismissed this claim.\n On December 8, 2017, McRae filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (the \u201cOSHA\u201d), alleging that his \u201cinvestigation and reporting\u201d to the Company\u2019s CEO was a contributing factor in the termination of his alleged employment by the Company in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act whistleblower\u2019s provisions. On January 2, 2018, the Company delivered its response to the complaint, denying each of McRae\u2019s allegations and providing its own presentation of the facts. McRae dismissed the OSHA claim with prejudice, and the matter cannot be brought again.\n On May 5, 2020 the Company settled with the McRae estate for 50 million common shares. We valued the shares at the settlement date (May 5, 2020 on which date our closing price was $0.0029) and recorded a Gain on Litigation in the amount of $105,000, a reduction of the amount of the liability to $145,000 as a result of that revaluation."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes organization in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_151", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Item 3.

The complaint goes on to allege 2) that the Company committed fraud by silence for failing to inform him of an intent to receive the benefit of his services while harboring an intent to not compensate him, 3) that the Company breached an unwritten agreement with him to provide him with 185,000,000 shares of the Company\u2019s common stock, and 4) that the Company breached a convertible promissory note by failing and refusing to repay him the principal and accrued interest thereunder. Complaint number 4 is now moot in the belief of the Company since after the lawsuit was filed the Company continued to repay McRae\u2019s convertible promissory note on schedule with interest due until paid in full on October 1, 2018, thus extinguishing the note and making the matter moot. These matters remain before the Court.\n On December 12, 2017, McRae brought the Company before the Kansas Human Rights Commission and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) alleging that on June 16, 2017 he was terminated from an alleged employment by the Company on the basis of race and for retaliation, and that the Company discriminated against him in the terms of this alleged employment because of race. The Kansas Human Rights Commission dismissed this claim.\n On December 8, 2017, McRae filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (the \u201cOSHA\u201d), alleging that his \u201cinvestigation and reporting\u201d to the Company\u2019s CEO was a contributing factor in the termination of his alleged employment by the Company in violation of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act whistleblower\u2019s provisions. On January 2, 2018, the Company delivered its response to the complaint, denying each of McRae\u2019s allegations and providing its own presentation of the facts. McRae dismissed the OSHA claim with prejudice, and the matter cannot be brought again.\n On May 5, 2020 the Company settled with the McRae estate for 50 million common shares. We valued the shares at the settlement date (May 5, 2020 on which date our closing price was $0.0029) and recorded a Gain on Litigation in the amount of $105,000, a reduction of the amount of the liability to $145,000 as a result of that revaluation."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes quantity in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_162", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Item 3.

Pursuant to ASC 820, the fair value of the Company\u2019s cash is determined based on \u201cLevel 1\u201d inputs, which consist of quoted prices in active markets for identical assets."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes monetary value in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_284", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "The Company adopted the standard as of January 1, 2019. The adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations or consolidated statements of cash flows.\n Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of these financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We regularly evaluate estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of convertible debentures, assumptions used to determine the fair value of stock-based compensation and derivative liabilities, and deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. We base our estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from our estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.\n Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board\u2019s (FASB) Accounting Codification Standard No. 820 (\u201cASC 820), Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. ASC 820 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure of fair value measurements. ASC 820 applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and accordingly, does not require any new fair value measurements. ASC 820 clarifies that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. As a basis for considering such assumptions, ASC 820 established a three-tier fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:\nLevel 1 - Observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\nLevel 2 - Inputs, other than the quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data, which require the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\n The Company\u2019s financial instruments consist principally of cash, amounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities, due to related parties and convertible notes.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n Basis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management.

Tautachrome\u2019s ACE is the first fully described imagery certification system that reflects all the attributes of an NFT on a blockchain.\n Dr. Jon N Leonard, Tautachrome CEO states \u201cAn NFT, being a tradeable asset that represents a real digital entity, is a trustable trading asset only to the extent that the entity it represents is secure and its unique identity is reliably authenticable. Unfortunately, in today\u2019s hot NFT market, NFTs have been sold claiming to represent unique art, without any means for proving the authenticity of the claim. That is a sure way to destabilize the NFT market, and it is the reason that security and authenticity are built into the Company\u2019s processes so as to automatically guarantee these crucial NFT features.\u201d"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes monetary value in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_374", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "The Company has completed development of a fully integrated mobile commerce app and platform, the ARknet app and platform, able to host consumers and their social interaction and businesses selling to those consumers, all facilitated by advanced 3D augmented reality interfaces for purchasing and interacting. In addition, we have high-speed blockchain technologies in development in support of frictionless sales, including supporting the creation and sale of blockchain tokens (NFTs) representing unique digital imagery assets owned by the Arknet platform participants. These technologies are being rolled out beginning in the US and aiming for a global operation.\n The ARknet platform\nThe ARknet mobile platform is designed to provide a fully integrated and untethered mobile experience, where untethering means moving from the physical screen of a PC or mobile device to a virtual screen through our augmented reality technology. Fully integrated means consumers can seamlessly and intuitively reach any provider or any friend for any purpose without leaving the platform. Tautachrome\u2019s MainSt campaign, kicked off in September 2020, was built to integrate the nation\u2019s devasted small retail businesses onto the ARknet platform in such a way that with a single sign-on, a customer can buy from any business on the platform, achieving fast and seamless business integration across any number of businesses (https://mainst.shopping). And in Q1 2021 the ARknet app releases 1.8.2 through 1.8.6 completed the integration onto the platform of essential social features such as sharing, following, posting, meetups and chat, for a gentle marriage of business with social, and in addition added advanced 3D AR features.\n Download the ARknet app for Android\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.honeycombarchive.ARknet\nDownload the ARknet app for iOS\nhttps://apps.apple.com/us/app/ARknet/id1466870072\nNon fungible tokens (\u201cNFTs\u201d), a technology captured in the Company\u2019s long standing patents\nNFTs, tradeable blockchain tokens each representing a unique digital asset, are the new rage in the marketing of digital imagery.

The amount of base salary for each executive officer will be reviewed and set annually by the Board of Directors. While base salary is intended to fit into our overall compensation objectives by serving to attract and retain talented executive officers, the size of the Company and the nature and stage of its business will also impact the level of base salary.\n We intend to use option-based awards as a variable element of compensation to attract and reward talented executives and professionals. Option-based awards are intended fit into our overall compensation objectives by aligning the interests of executive officers with those of the Company and linking individual compensation to its performance. The Board of Directors will be responsible for setting and amending any equity incentive plan under which an option based award would be granted. Previous grants of stock options will be taken into account when considering new grants.\n We intend to award bonuses at our sole discretion and do not have any pre-existing performance criteria or objectives.\n At this time we do not provide medical, dental, pension or other benefits to our executive officers.\n Employment Agreements\nThe Company has an employment agreement with Dr. Jon Leonard, the Company\u2019s Chief Executive Officer at a compensation rate of $60,000 (which increases 5% per year) and six weeks per year of paid vacation."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_720", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Other than the agreement in the previous paragraph, there are no employment agreements or arrangements, whether written or unwritten, between the Company and any of its executive officers.
