Our cloud-architected portfolio of customer engagement and digital process automation applications leverages artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d), case management, and robotic automation technology, built on our unified low code Pega Platform, empowering businesses to quickly design, extend, and scale their enterprise applications to meet strategic business needs.\n To grow our business, we intend to:\n\u2022increase market share by developing and delivering market-leading applications for marketing, sales, service, and operations that can work together seamlessly with maximum competitive differentiation;\n\u2022execute new-market growth initiatives, further expanding go-to-market coverage within the Global 3000; and\n\u2022continue to scale our marketing efforts to support the way today\u2019s clients discover, evaluate, and buy products and services.\n Whether we are successful depends, in part, on our ability to:\n\u2022execute our marketing and sales strategies;\n\u2022appropriately manage our expenses as we grow our organization;\n\u2022effectively develop new products and enhance our existing products; and\n\u2022incorporate acquired technologies into our applications and unified Pega Platform.\n Cloud Transition\nWe are in the process of transitioning our business to sell software primarily through subscription arrangements, particularly Pega Cloud (\u201cCloud Transition\u201d). Until we substantially complete our Cloud Transition, which we anticipate will occur in early 2023, we expect to continue to experience lower revenue growth and lower operating cash flow growth or negative cash flow. The actual mix of revenue and new arrangements in a given period can fluctuate based on client preferences.\n See risk factor \"If we fail to manage our transition to a more subscription-based business model successfully, our results of operations and/or cash flows could be negatively impacted.\" in"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_15", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "ITEM 1A.

Typically, we enter into license agreements that contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of product liability and warranty claims. There is a risk that a court might interpret these terms in a limited way or could hold part or all of these terms to be unenforceable. Also, there is a risk that these contract terms might not bind a party other than the direct client. Furthermore, some of our licenses with our clients are governed by non-U.S. law, and there is a risk that foreign law might give us less or different protection. Although we have not experienced any material product liability claims to date, a product liability suit or action claiming a breach of warranty, whether meritorious, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and our resources.\n Risks Related to Our Financial Obligations and Indebtedness\nWe have a significant amount of debt that may decrease our business flexibility, access to capital, and/or increase our borrowing costs, and we may still incur additional debt in the future, which may adversely affect our operations and financial results.\n As of December 31, 2020, we had $600 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness under our Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 (the \u201cNotes\u201d).\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_165", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Our ability to pay our debt when due or refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control.

Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances.

In accounting for the issuance of the Notes, the Company separated the Notes into liability and equity components. The carrying amount of the liability component was calculated by measuring the fair value of a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature.

The Company\u2019s leases do not contain any material residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants.\n Internal-use software\nThe Company capitalizes and amortizes certain direct costs associated with computer software developed or purchased for internal use incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. The Company amortizes capitalized software costs generally over three to five years, commencing on the date the software is placed into service.\n Goodwill\nGoodwill represents the residual purchase price paid in a business combination after the fair value of all identified assets and liabilities have been recorded. Goodwill is not amortized. The Company has a single reporting unit. The Company performed a qualitative assessment as of November 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, and concluded that there was no impairment since it was not more likely than not that the fair value of its reporting unit was less than its carrying value.\n Intangible and long-lived assets\nAll of the Company\u2019s intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful life. The Company evaluates its long-lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets\u2019 carrying amount may not be recoverable. Impairment is assessed by comparing the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the long-lived tangible or intangible assets to their carrying value. If impairment exists, the Company calculates the impairment by comparing the carrying value to its fair value as determined by discounted expected cash flows.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_768", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Business combinations\nThe Company uses its best estimates and assumptions to assign a fair value to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date.

Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the fair value of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to the Company\u2019s consolidated statements of operations.\n Research and development and software development costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. Capitalization of computer software developed for resale begins upon the establishment of technological feasibility, generally demonstrated by a working model or an operative version of the computer software product. Such costs have not been material to date, as technological feasibility is established within a short time frame from the software\u2019s general availability. As a result, no costs were capitalized in 2020, 2019, or 2018.\n Stock-based compensation\nThe Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense associated with equity awards based on the award\u2019s fair value at the grant date. Stock-based compensation is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the equity award and is adjusted each period for anticipated forfeitures. See \"Note 14. Stock-Based Compensation\" for discussion of the Company\u2019s key assumptions included in determining the fair value of its equity awards at the grant date.\n Foreign currency translation and remeasurement\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_783", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Revenue and expense accounts are translated at the average exchange rates during the period transactions occurred.
