MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. This Report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. See \u201cSpecial Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d and Part I, Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d Readers are also urged to carefully review and consider these and other disclosures made by us which attempt to advise interested parties of the factors which affect our business.\n Introduction and Overview\nProviding software solutions that simplify and enhance the mobile experience to some of the leading wireless and cable service providers around the globe is a mission that Smith Micro pursues with passion. From enabling the family digital lifestyle to providing powerful voice messaging capabilities, we strive to enrich today\u2019s connected lifestyles while creating new opportunities to engage consumers via smartphones and consumer IoT devices. The Smith Micro portfolio includes a wide range of products for creating, sharing and monetizing rich content, such as visual voice messaging, retail content display optimization and performance analytics on any product set.\n During 2020, we experienced an increase in our wireless revenues primarily due to entering 2020 with a higher number of subscribers than the prior year. However, as the year progressed, the continued growth of SafePath subscriber numbers was negatively impacted by the closure of customer retail stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic combined with the T-Mobile / Sprint merger. CommSuite revenues were relatively stable during 2020. The Company received additional cash proceeds of $4.2 million during 2020 from the exercise of warrants previously issued as part of 2018 private placements of common stock undertaken by the Company.\nResults of Operations\nRevenues generated from our sales to T-Mobile (including Sprint, prior to its merger with T-Mobile) and its affiliates accounted for 81% and 84% of the Company\u2019s total revenues and 91% and 92% of accounts receivable for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n The following table sets forth certain consolidated statement operations data as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated:\nYear Ended December 31,\nRevenues\n100.0\n%\n100.0\n%\nCost of revenues\n10.1\n9.1\nGross profit\n89.9\n90.9\nOperating expenses:\nSelling and marketing\n20.9\n17.3\nResearch and development\n37.2\n27.0\nGeneral and administrative\n25.0\n22.9\nRestructuring expenses\n-\n0.4\nTotal operating expenses\n83.1\n67.6\nOperating income\n6.8\n23.3\nGain on sale of software products\n1.4\n1.1\nInterest income\n0.2\n0.5\nOther expense\n-\n-\nIncome before provision for income taxes\n8.4\n24.9\nProvision for income tax expense\n0.3\n0.2\nNet income\n8.1\n%\n24.7\n%\nRevenues and Expense Components\nThe following is a description of the primary components of our revenues and expenses:\nRevenues.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years then ended, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\u201cPCAOB\u201d), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization on the Treadway Commission in 2013, and our report dated March 13, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.\n Basis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company\u2019s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud.\n Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes person in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": ["Timothy C.

ViewSpot product is a cloud based platform that its Mobile Network Operator customers use to display its promotional content to mobile devices being sold in its retail outlets. Using this solution, the MNOs have the ability to promote specific mobile devices in targeted geographic retail locations and monitor the efficacy of the promotions and the mobile device user\u2019s behavior to the targeted advertising.

ViewSpot services depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the on-premise applications, consulting services and the cloud services, and are accounted for together as a single performance obligation.

Historically, returns have been insignificant.\n Deferred Revenue\nUnearned revenue represents amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized. Unearned revenue primarily consists of the unearned portion of monthly, quarterly and annually billed service fees and prepayments made by customers for a future period. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control. As of December 31, 2020, our total deferred revenue balance was $1.6 million, of which $1.5 million was related to the acquisition of the Circle operator business.\n Costs to Obtain a Customer Contract\nWe generally pay sales commissions to our sales force, which are incremental and recoverable costs of acquiring contracts. In most instances, sales commissions are only paid when we earn usage based fees on the contracts. The commission obligation is established each quarter based on the usage based fees earned. The commission obligation is not adjusted by future usage based fees earned, that is each period is discrete from the other. As a result of the structure of the commission plan, we record the commission expense when the commission obligation is determined, which is generally quarterly.\n In the second quarter of 2019, we introduced an amended and restated sales commission plan that incentivizes and recognizes the efforts of eligible participants to earn commissions on future revenue generated on new contracts, sale of a new product to an existing contract, or sale of a product to a different group within an existing customer. The sales commissions are tiered based on the opportunity size.

On June 27, 2016, we received a letter from the State of Pennsylvania requesting reimbursement of $0.3 million and said we earned the remaining $0.7 million of the original $1.0 million grant. On September 19, 2016, we entered into a Settlement and Release Agreement with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, acting by and through the Department of Community and Economic Development to repay $0.3 million of the original $1.0 million grant in quarterly installments commencing on January 31, 2017.
