Nature of Operations\nCompany Overview\nThe operations of Advanced Voice Recognition Systems, Inc. (\u201cAVRS\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d), http://www.avrsys.com, commenced in 1994 with a predecessor entity called NCC, Inc. NCC, Inc. was incorporated on March 15, 1994 in the State of Ohio. NCC, Inc. operated as a software and hardware development company that marketed voice recognition and transcription products for commercial applications.\n In May 2000, WG Investments, LLC acquired the assets of NCC, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to NCC, LLC. NCC, LLC (also a predecessor to AVRS) continued the operations of NCC, Inc. until approximately December 31, 2001, when shifts in the industry\u2019s markets caused NCC, LLC to suspend its operations.\n AVRS was incorporated in the State of Colorado on July 7, 2005. In September 2005, the members of NCC, LLC transferred all of their membership interests in NCC, LLC to AVRS in exchange for 93,333,333 shares (post-recapitalization) of AVRS common stock. In December 2005, the Board of Directors approved a 1.5-to-1 stock split issuing 46,666,667 common shares (post-recapitalization), which increased the number of common shares outstanding to 140 million shares (post-capitalization). Following the incorporation of AVRS, the Company initiated a new business plan and intends to continue its operations in the voice recognition and transcription industry.\n AVRS is a software development company specializing in speech recognition technologies. AVRS has successfully obtained patent protection of its proprietary technology (refer to Note 3, Intangible Assets). The Company has currently engaged a firm to investigate and asserting claims relating to certain patents including negotiating licensing agreements and the filing and prosecution of lawsuits.\n Stock Exchange Agreement\nOn April 28, 2008, the Company entered into a Stock Exchange Agreement (\u201cthe Agreement\u201d) with Samoyed Energy Corp., a Nevada corporation (\u201cSamoyed\u201d), which resulted in a reverse acquisition.
