officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15. Such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company is accumulated and communicated to the appropriate management on a basis that permits timely decisions regarding disclosure. Based upon that evaluation, the Company's principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that the Company's disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020 were not effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in the Company\u2019s periodic filings under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n Management's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\u25cf\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and\n\u25cf\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n In connection with the preparation of our annual financial statements, Gust Kepler, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, has assessed the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, or the COSO Framework, and SEC guidance on conducting such assessments. Management\u2019s assessment included an evaluation of the design of our internal control over financial reporting and testing of the operational effectiveness of those controls. Based on this evaluation and qualified by the \u201cLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls\u201d set forth in this Item 9A below, management has determined that as of December 31, 2020, our internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\n The Company\u2019s management has identified a material weakness in the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting related to a shortage of resources in the accounting department required to assure appropriate segregation of duties with employees having appropriate accounting qualifications.\n Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThis Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting. Management's report was not subject to attestation by the Company\u2019s registered public accounting firm pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, wherein non-accelerated filers are exempt from Sarbanes-Oxley internal control audit requirements.\n Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020 that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal controls over financial reporting.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes organization in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_331", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "ITEM 9A.\nCONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nGust Kepler, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company's disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020, pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 13a-15.

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6, the Company executed a Loan Agreement with certain lenders (the \u201cLenders\u201d) and FVP Servicing LLC, (\u201cFVP\u201d), as agent for the Lenders in connection with the issuance of a Note in the amount of $1,000,000 bearing interest at 12% per annum with an initial maturity of November 12, 2022. Simultaneously, with the execution of the Loan Agreement, the Company repaid an existing secured note payable in the amount of $100,000 along with accrued interest, and certain outstanding trade payables in the amount of $133,880. In addition, the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of its assets. As a result of this financing and the cash flows from operations, the Company had a cash balance of $972,825 at December 31, 2020. Management believes that this will be sufficient to fund its operations and service its debt for the next twelve months. In addition, management may continue to raise additional debt or equity capital in order to improve liquidity or finance more aggressive growth or development. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to raise additional capital or on what terms.\n The financial statements do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue in operation.\n Use of Estimates. The Company\u2019s financial statement preparation requires that management make estimates and assumptions which affect the reporting of assets and liabilities and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in order to report these financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n Cash.

These conditions raise substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 6, the Company executed a Loan Agreement with certain lenders (the \u201cLenders\u201d) and FVP Servicing LLC, (\u201cFVP\u201d), as agent for the Lenders in connection with the issuance of a Note in the amount of $1,000,000 bearing interest at 12% per annum with an initial maturity of November 12, 2022. Simultaneously, with the execution of the Loan Agreement, the Company repaid an existing secured note payable in the amount of $100,000 along with accrued interest, and certain outstanding trade payables in the amount of $133,880. In addition, the Company granted the Lender a security interest in substantially all of its assets. As a result of this financing and the cash flows from operations, the Company had a cash balance of $972,825 at December 31, 2020.

The Company will recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered. The Company provides a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which it does not consider realization of such assets to be more likely than not.\n Management evaluates the probability of the realization of its deferred income tax assets. Management determined that because the Company has not yet generated taxable income, it is unlikely that a tax benefit will be realized from these operating loss carry forwards. Accordingly, the deferred income tax asset is offset by a full valuation allowance.\n In accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be capable of withstanding examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. These standards prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\n Earnings or (Loss) Per Share. Basic earnings per share (or loss per share), is computed by dividing the earnings (loss) for the period by the weighted average number of common stock shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities by including other potentially issuable shares of common stock, including shares issuable upon conversion of convertible securities or exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants, in the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period.

The following three levels of inputs may be used to measure fair value:\nLevel 1 inputs utilize unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Company has the ability to access;\nLevel 2 inputs utilize other-than-quoted prices that are observable, either directly or indirectly and include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs such as interest rates and yield curves that are observable at commonly quoted intervals; and\nLevel 3 inputs are unobservable and are typically based on our own assumptions, including situations where there is little, if any, market activity.\n The following table presents the Company\u2019s liabilities that were measured and recognized at fair value as of December 31, 2020:\n Level 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\nBalance January 1, 2019\n-\n-\n-\nAdditions\n-\n-\n$ 1,321,764\nChange in Fair Value\n-\n-\n83,766\nBalance at December 31, 2019\n$ -\n$ -\n$ 1,405,530\nAdditions\n-\n-\n317,776\nAmendments\n-\n-\n(224,066 )\nRetirements\n-\n-\n(567,588 )\nChange in Fair Value\n-\n-\n(931,652 )\nBalance at December 31, 2020\n$ -\n$ -\n$ -\n8.
