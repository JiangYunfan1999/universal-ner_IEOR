Sales to certain customers and groups of customers can be impacted by seasonal capital expenditure approval cycles, and sales to customers within certain geographic regions can be subject to seasonal fluctuations in demand.\n In 2020, 86.3 % of our revenue was derived from a variety of U.S. government entities through direct sales and indirectly through system integrators and resellers. These sales are attributable to five U.S. Government customers through direct and indirect channels; three exceeded 10% of total revenue individually in 2020. Comparatively, sales to the U.S. Government through direct and indirect channels totaled 87.4% of total revenues for 2019. Those sales were attributable to ten U.S. Government customers through direct and indirect channels; three exceeded 10% of total revenue individually in 2019.

Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\n Our Business\nWe develop, sell and support products that protect any-sized company or government organization by fusing advanced threat intelligence with real-time artificial intelligence to neutralize cyberattacks as they occur - including Zero-Day attacks. We market and distribute our solutions through a direct sales force and value-added resellers. Our end-user customers include U.S. federal government entities, state and local government entities, and companies ranging in size from mid-market to large enterprises.\n Our Solutions\nINTRUSION Shield\nINTRUSION Shield, our cornerstone cybersecurity solution is a comprehensive, real-time AI-based Security-as-a-Service that inspects and kills all dangerous network connections before they can do damage. What makes our approach unique is that it inspects every packet of inbound and outbound traffic and analyzes the reputation of the IP addresses (source and destination), the domain and ports it is communicating on, along with many other fields in the packet to neutralize malicious connections.\n Most breaches today are caused by malware free compromises that trigger no alarms in a firewall or endpoint solution. The common denominator is network communications, which Shield monitors and analyses, allowing Shield to identify and stop all attacks, even malware-free attacks. Shield\u2019s capabilities continuously evolve based on constant machine learning and neural networking technology. Unlike traditional industry approaches that rely heavily on human mitigation and defensive approaches, which malicious actors and nation states have learned to bypass, Shield\u2019s proprietary architecture isolates and neutralizes malicious traffic and network flows that existing solutions cannot identify before they harm a corporation or government organization.\n Shield is designed as a next generation Network Detection and Response solution. After 30 years of providing research, analysis, tools and services to the federal government and enterprise corporations, Intrusion possesses a comprehensive and proprietary data set of petabytes of Internet traffic, including information about the activities of malicious online actors. Shield integrates this rich TraceCop data set with artificial intelligence (AI) and Savant real-time process flow technology to provide our customers with a unique and affordable tool to detect, identify, and neutralize cyberattacks. In particular, the Shield AI has been specifically trained to identify and stop Zero-Day attacks and ransomware, the most prolific and crippling forms of malware today.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_270", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "It contains largest repository of reputation information on known good and known bad active IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6).

All this makes it a very effective network forensics and cybersecurity analysis tool to inform Shield.\n INTRUSION Savant\nINTRUSION Savant is a network monitoring solution that leverages the rich data available in TraceCop to identify suspicious traffic in real-time. Savant uses several original patents to uniquely characterize and record all network flows. Savant is a network reconnaissance and attack analysis tool used by forensic analysts in the DoD, Federal Government and corporations with in-house threat research teams. For example, Savant users can create various automated rules to inspect packets matching (or not) certain criteria such as creating a rule to ensure the Source MAC address field in the Ethernet header and Source IP address from the IP header are always the same, failing which could indicate MAC or IP Spoofing in progress. Similarly, threat investigators can create rules using regular expressions by combining multiple fields in the packet headers. Ultimately, the rich capabilities of Savant provides the real-time analysis that Shield uses to make decisions on whether or not a packet is malicious.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_285", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.

Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of product revenue.\n Allowances for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments. Our receivables are uncollateralized, and we expect to continue this policy in the future. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, increased allowances may be required. Historically, our estimates for sales returns and doubtful accounts have not differed materially from actual results.\n Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nWe calculate the fair value of our assets and liabilities which qualify as financial instruments and include additional information in the notes to consolidated financial statements when the fair value is different than the carrying value of these financial instruments. The estimated fair value of accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and dividends payable approximate their carrying amounts due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments. Financing leases and PPP loan approximate fair value as they bear market rates of interest.\n Results of Operations\nThe following tables set forth, for the periods indicated, certain financial data as a percentage of net revenue.\n Year Ended December 31,\nNet product revenue 100.0 % 100.0 %\nTotal cost of revenue 40.9 39.2\nGross profit 59.1 60.8\nOperating expenses:\nSales and marketing 57.7 9.5\nResearch and development 57.4 9.6\nGeneral and administrative 42.5 8.7\nOperating income (loss) (98.5 ) 33.0\nInterest expense (0.1 ) (0.3 )\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_315", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "We did not meet sales projections for our TraceCop product line.
