In future years, if we fail to timely complete this assessment, or if our independent auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, there may be a loss of public confidence in our internal controls, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to regulatory sanctions or investigations by the NASDAQ Stock Market, the Securities and Exchange Commission or other regulatory authorities, which would require additional financial and management resources. In addition, any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to timely meet our regulatory reporting obligations.\n During the past several years, our organizational structure has increased in complexity due to compliance with tax regulations and tax accounting requirements and other regulatory and compliance requirements, including compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and the UK Bribery Act of 2010 (the \u201cUK Bribery Act\u201d). Further, we have expanded our presence in the Asia-Pacific region, where business practices can differ from those in other regions of the world and can create internal control risks. We provide business practices training to our employees worldwide. Overall, the combination of increased structural complexity and the ever-increasing regulatory complexity make it more critical for us to attract and retain qualified and technically competent employees.\n We may experience a decline in revenues or volatility in our quarterly operating results, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\n We cannot predict our future quarterly revenues or operating results with certainty because of many factors outside of our control. A significant revenue or profit decline, lowered forecasts or volatility in our operating results could cause the market price of our common stock to decline substantially. Factors that could affect our revenues and operating results include the following:\n\u2022the unpredictability of the timing and magnitude of orders for our software applications, particularly software transactions greater than $100,000 - in recent fiscal years, a majority of our quarterly revenues were earned and recorded near the end of each quarter;\n\u2022the possibility that our customers may cancel, defer or limit purchases as a result of reduced information technology budgets;\n\u2022the possibility that our customers may defer purchases of our software applications in anticipation of new software applications or updates from us or our competitors;\n\u2022the ability of our OEMs and resellers to meet their sales objectives;\n\u2022market acceptance of our new applications and enhancements;\n\u2022our ability to control expenses;\n\u2022changes in our pricing, packaging and distribution terms or those of our competitors; and\n\u2022the demands on our management, sales force and services infrastructure as a result of the introduction of new software applications or updates.\n Our expense levels are relatively fixed and are based, in part, on our expectations of future revenues."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes indicator in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_538", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"SOX 404\"), and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC to implement SOX 404, we are required to furnish a report in our Form 10-K regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

The number of record holders does not represent the actual number of beneficial owners of shares of our common stock because shares are frequently held in street name by securities dealers and others for the benefit of individual owners who have the right to vote their shares.\n Dividend Policy\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock, and we intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the growth of our business. We therefore do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.

To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions generally results in increased revenue, operating expenses and income from operations for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, our revenue, operating expenses and net income will generally decrease for our non-U.S. operations if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies.\n Using the average foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal 2020, our software and products revenue would have been lower by $6.8 million, our services revenue would have been lower by $6.6 million, our cost of sales would have been lower by $1.8 million and our operating expenses would have been lower by $4.5 million from non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2021.\n In addition, we are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from cash balances, accounts receivables and intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to the resulting transaction gains and losses, which are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.

Also included in this category are other general corporate expenses, such as outside legal and accounting services, compliance costs and insurance; and\n\u2022Depreciation and Amortization, consists of depreciation expense primarily for our owned corporate campus headquarters location and computer equipment we use for information services and in our development and test labs as well as amortization of intangible assets acquired through the purchase of Hedvig beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 through the second quarter of fiscal year 2021 when the intangible assets were impaired to zero.\n Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\u2019 Impact on Results of Operations\nSales outside the United States were approximately 48% of our total revenue for fiscal 2021, 49% of our total revenue for fiscal 2020 and 47% for fiscal 2019. The income statements of our non-U.S. operations are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates for each applicable month in a period. To the extent the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated transactions generally results in increased revenue, operating expenses and income from operations for our non-U.S. operations. Similarly, our revenue, operating expenses and net income will generally decrease for our non-U.S. operations if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies.\n Using the average foreign currency exchange rates from fiscal 2020, our software and products revenue would have been lower by $6.8 million, our services revenue would have been lower by $6.6 million, our cost of sales would have been lower by $1.8 million and our operating expenses would have been lower by $4.5 million from non-U.S. operations for fiscal 2021.\n In addition, we are exposed to risks of foreign currency fluctuation primarily from cash balances, accounts receivables and intercompany accounts denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to the resulting transaction gains and losses, which are recorded as a component of general and administrative expenses.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at March 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended March 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting as of March 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated May 13, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n Adoption of New Accounting Standard\nAs discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed its method for accounting for leases in 2020.\n Basis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company\u2019s management.

We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks.

Most of the Company\u2019s contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations which are accounted for separately, if they are distinct. The transaction price is allocated to separate performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis.

Auditing the allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations requires significant judgment in determining whether the use of the residual approach to estimate the standalone selling prices of software is appropriate.\n How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company\u2019s revenue recognition process, including the evaluation of the contractual terms of the revenue arrangements and the Company\u2019s assessment of the appropriateness of the residual approach for estimating the standalone selling prices of software.\n To test the amount of revenue recognized, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, testing a sample of revenue transactions during the year and evaluating the identification of performance obligations based on analysis of the contractual terms and independent confirmations of the terms and conditions of the contract directly with customers. Our testing of the application of the residual approach to estimate standalone selling prices of software included inquiries with management and analysis of the variability of actual software pricing during the year by customer class.\n We have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 1998.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nIselin, New Jersey\nMay 13, 2021\nCommvault Systems, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n March 31,\n2021 2020\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents $ 397,237 $ 288,082\nRestricted cash - 8,000\nShort-term investments - 43,645\nTrade accounts receivable, net 188,126 146,990\nOther current assets 22,237 26,969\nTotal current assets 607,600 513,686\nProperty and equipment, net 112,779 114,519\nOperating lease assets 20,778 15,009\nDeferred commissions cost 38,444 31,394\nIntangible assets, net - 46,350\nGoodwill 112,435 112,435\nOther assets 12,137 11,683\nTotal assets $ 904,173 $ 845,076\nLIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS\u2019 EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable $ 374 $ 307\nAccrued liabilities 112,148 87,051\nCurrent portion of operating lease liabilities 7,469 7,699\nDeferred revenue 253,211 233,497\nTotal current liabilities 373,202 328,554\nDeferred revenue, less current portion 119,231 92,723\nDeferred tax liabilities, net 761 849\nLong-term operating lease liabilities 15,419 8,808\nOther liabilities 1,526 2,238\nCommitments and contingencies (Note 8)\nStockholders\u2019 equity:\nPreferred stock, $0.01 par value: 50,000 shares authorized, no shares issued and outstanding\n- -\nCommon stock, $0.01 par value, 250,000 shares authorized, 46,482 shares and 46,011 shares issued and outstanding at March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively\n463 458\nAdditional paid-in capital 1,069,695 978,659\nAccumulated deficit (665,774) (553,790)\n Accumulated other comprehensive loss (10,350) (13,423)\nTotal stockholders\u2019 equity 394,034 411,904\nTotal liabilities and stockholders\u2019 equity $ 904,173 $ 845,076\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements\nCommvault Systems, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\n(In thousands, except per share data)\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes organization in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_939", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\n Accounting for Revenue Recognition\nDescription of the Matter\nAs described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company derives revenues from two primary sources: software and services.

The most significant impact of the legislation for the Company was the reduction of the value of the Company's net deferred tax assets (which represent future tax benefits) as a result of lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Act also included a requirement to pay a one-time transition tax on the cumulative value of earnings and profits that were previously not repatriated for U.S. income tax purposes. We have concluded that the one-time transition tax is zero. In addition, we no longer consider the undistributed earnings held outside of the U.S. by most of its foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested.\n The Act subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (\"GILTI\") earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. The FASB Staff Q&A, Topic 740, No. 5, Accounting for GILTI, states that an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred as a period expense only. Because the Company was evaluating the provisions of GILTI as of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2018, it recorded no GILTI-related deferred amounts in the financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2018. After further consideration, the Company has elected to account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred, and has recorded an estimate of GILTI as a component of the projected tax provision for the fiscal years ending March 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n Commvault Systems, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements - (Continued)\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nValuation Allowance\nNet deferred tax assets arise due to the recognition of income and expense items for tax purposes, which differ from those used for financial statement purposes. ASC 740, Income Taxes, provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of such assets is more likely than not.
