The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n Revenue Recognition - Deferral Period of Maintenance Contracts\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, revenue is recognized when the promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to for those goods or services. In addition, the Company markets and licenses its products indirectly through resellers, as well as directly to end-customers. In providing maintenance contracts, the Company must make estimates as to the commencement and end dates for certain new and renewal periods for various reasons, including bulk activations and renewals from resellers who obtain and renew maintenance contracts on behalf of many end-users with varying renewal dates, and renewal periods that may lapse and later be renewed. Maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period, which is generally between one and five years.\n How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to this critical audit matter included the following, among others:\nWe obtained an understanding, and evaluated the design and implementation, of key controls that address the risk of material misstatements relating to the timing and amounts of revenue recognition for maintenance contracts described above.\n We obtained a sample of contracts with customers that included maintenance elements for both new and existing customers. We read the contract and the related terms and price, and the specified maintenance element. We agreed the price and term of the maintenance element to proper inclusion within the Company\u2019s deferred revenue schedule management utilizes to control and record deferred revenue and relieve earned revenue.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\n We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer (Principal Financial Officer), as appropriate, to allow for timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can only provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\n Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer, we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) under the Exchange Act) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020.\n Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere has not been any change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the quarter ended December 31, 2020 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer and effected by our Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u25cf pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets; and\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, and our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors; and\n\u25cf provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material impact on the financial statements.\n Because of inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting includes using the criteria in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013), an integrated framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, for the evaluation of internal control to identify the risks and control objectives related to the evaluation of our control environment.\n Based on our evaluation under the framework described above, our management has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020.\n This Annual Report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial reporting.
