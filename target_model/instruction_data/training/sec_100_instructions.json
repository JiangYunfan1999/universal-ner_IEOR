We believe that, when implemented, our solution offers businesses and organizations the opportunity to reach more customers, improve brand image, build additional brand loyalty, and, most importantly, provide an accessible and usable web experience to the expansive and ever-growing global population of individuals with disabilities.\n AudioEye primarily generates revenue through the sale of subscriptions for our software-as-a-service (\u201cSaaS\u201d) accessibility solutions. Our solutions are backed by AudioEye\u2019s machine-learning/AI-driven technology that finds and fixes common accessibility errors. Our core and supplemental solutions are designed to help websites and applications achieve and sustain substantial conformance with AudioEye\u2019s interpretation of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (\u201cWCAG\u201d) which are web accessibility standards published by the Web Accessibility Initiative of the World Wide Web Consortium, the main international standards organization for the internet. Our solutions help mitigate a customer\u2019s risk of costly digital accessibility-related legal action. AudioEye customers may purchase solutions directly through the AudioEye Marketplace, through a platform partner or an agency, such as Duda, that integrates our solutions into their marketplace, through a vertical Content Management System (\u201cCMS\u201d) partner, or through an authorized reseller, or by working directly with the AudioEye sales team. Our offerings serve businesses and organizations of all sizes and at all price points.\n AudioEye stands out among its competitors because it delivers machine-learning/artificial intelligence (\u201cAI\u201d)-driven accessibility without fundamental changes to the website architecture. As another differentiator, we offer transparency. Our offerings provide automated remediations and a transparent compliance score with additional manually driven enhancements. AudioEye pairs its patented technology solutions with certified accessibility experts, which allows our customers to achieve a higher level of compliance than competitors relying solely on automation. Our technology publishes more than one billion remediations daily, and our solution is trusted by some of the largest and most influential companies in the world, including ADP, Tommy Hilfiger, 360 Media, Samsung, Darden, Landry\u2019s and more."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes monetary value in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_14", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Item 1.

The United States and other key international economies have experienced cyclical downturns from time to time in which economic activity was impacted by falling demand for a variety of goods and services, restricted credit, poor liquidity, reduced corporate profitability, volatility in credit, equity and foreign exchange markets, bankruptcies and overall uncertainty with respect to the economy. These economic conditions can arise suddenly, and the full impact of such conditions can remain uncertain. In addition, geopolitical developments, such as existing and potential trade wars and other events beyond our control, such as the coronavirus pandemic, can increase levels of political and economic unpredictability globally and increase the volatility of global financial markets. For example, in response to the coronavirus pandemic, we have shifted certain of our customer events to virtual-only experiences and we may deem it advisable to similarly alter, postpone or cancel entirely additional customer, employee or industry events in the future. Moreover, these conditions can affect the rate of IT spending and could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to attend our events or to purchase our software, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of their subscription contracts, affect attrition rates, or decrease our ability to collect on accounts receivable, all of which could adversely affect our future sales and operating results.\n We have been subject to litigation and may in the future be subject to additional litigation, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_136", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Because we are in a technology industry, these disputes may involve claims of intellectual property infringement or misappropriation.

The increase in working capital in 2020 was primarily a result of a public offering whereby the Company raised net proceeds of $7.8 million by issuing 473,239 shares of its common stock, as well as $880,000 received from a cash exercise of warrants by Sero Capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n In addition, on February 11, 2021, we entered into an At Market Issuance Sales Agreement (the \u201cSales Agreement\u201d) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. (\u201cAgent\u201d) under which the Company may offer and sell, from time to time at its sole discretion, shares of its common stock to or through the Agent as its sales agent, having an aggregate offering price of up to $30 million.

Controls and Procedures\nConclusions of Management Regarding Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that there is reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed in the Company\u2019s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to the Company\u2019s management, including its Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure based on the definition of \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures\u201d in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e). In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. In addition, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures to future periods are subject to the risk that controls or procedures may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the controls or procedures may deteriorate.\n As of the end of the period covered by this report, an evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company\u2019s senior management, including the Interim Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and procedures to provide reasonable assurance of achieving the desired objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures. In light of the material weaknesses noted below, our Interim Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective.\n The Company assessed the material weaknesses\u2019 impact to the financial statements to ensure they were prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and present fairly the financial results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management concluded that the financial statements included in this Form 10-K present fairly, in all material aspects, the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented.\n Management\u2019s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the Company and all related information appearing in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n1. pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets;\n2. provide reasonable assurance that the transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with the authorization of management and/or of our Board of Directors; and\n3. provide reasonable assurance regarding the prevention or timely detection of any unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.\n Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Our SaaS fees include support and maintenance.\n We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n We determine revenue recognition through the following five steps:\n\u00b7 Identify the contract with the customer;\n\u00b7 Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7 Determine the transaction price;\n\u00b7 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7 Recognize revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied.\n Performance obligations are the unit of accounting for revenue recognition and generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised to the customer. If we determine that we have not satisfied a performance obligation, we will defer recognition of the revenue until the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied. SaaS agreements are generally non-cancelable, although clients typically have the right to terminate their contracts for cause if we fail to perform material obligations.\n We may execute more than one contract with a single customer. We evaluate whether the agreements were negotiated as a package with a single objective, whether the amount of consideration to be paid in one agreement depends on the price and/or performance of another agreement, or whether the goods or services promised in the agreements represent a single performance obligation. The conclusions reached can impact the allocation of the transaction price to each performance obligation and the timing of revenue recognition related to those arrangements.\n Our SaaS (also referred to as \u201csubscription\u201d) revenue is comprised of fixed subscription fees from customer accounts on our platform. SaaS revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual subscription term of the arrangement beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer. Certain SaaS fees are invoiced in advance on an annual, semi-annual, or quarterly basis.

Our SaaS fees include support and maintenance.\n We recognize revenue in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d). The core principle of ASC 606 is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.\n We determine revenue recognition through the following five steps:\n\u00b7 Identify the contract with the customer;\n\u00b7 Identify the performance obligations in the contract;\n\u00b7 Determine the transaction price;\n\u00b7 Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n\u00b7 Recognize revenue when, or as, the performance obligations are satisfied.\n Performance obligations are the unit of accounting for revenue recognition and generally represent the distinct goods or services that are promised to the customer. If we determine that we have not satisfied a performance obligation, we will defer recognition of the revenue until the performance obligation is deemed to be satisfied.

We evaluate the capitalized costs for impairment and write off the carrying value of abandoned patents or patent applications. We also write off capitalized costs associated to patents not granted. Refer to Note 4 - Intangible Assets for additional information regarding our patents.\n Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nGoodwill is tested for impairment at least annually, and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events that may indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Events or circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in the business climate or in legal factors, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, a loss of key personnel, significant changes in the strategy for our overall business, significant negative industry or economic trends, significant underperformance relative to operating performance indicators, a significant decline in market capitalization and significant changes in competition. We complete our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year, at the reporting unit level, which is at the company level as a whole, since we operate in one single reporting segment.\n Intangible assets with a finite life are amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n We evaluate the need for an impairment charge relating to long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We consider the following to be some examples of indicators that may trigger an impairment review: (i) actual undiscounted cash flows significantly below historical or projected future undiscounted cash flows for the associated assets; (ii) significant changes in the manner or use of the assets or in our overall strategy with respect to the manner or use of the assets or changes in our overall business strategy; (iii) significant negative industry or economic trends; (iv) increased competitive pressures; and (v) a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period of time.\n Once we determine that a potential impairment indicator exists, we perform the test for recoverability by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the intangible assets with the intangible asset\u2019s carrying amount.
