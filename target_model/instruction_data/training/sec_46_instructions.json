Words such as \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"plans,\" \"believes,\" \"seeks,\" \"estimates\", \"could\", \"may\", \"should\", \"will\", \"would\", and similar expressions or variations of such words are intended to identify forward-looking statements in this report. Additionally, statements concerning future matters such as the development of new services, technology enhancements, purchase of equipment, credit arrangements, possible changes in legislation and other statements regarding matters that are not historical are forward-looking statements.\n Although forward-looking statements in this Annual Report reflect the good faith judgment of the Company's management, such statements can only be based on facts and factors currently known by the Company. Consequently, forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks, contingencies and uncertainties, and actual results and outcomes may differ materially from results and outcomes discussed in this report.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company's management, including the interim Chief Executive Officer /Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as its principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Based upon this evaluation, the interim Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive/financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n As described in our accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we have identified four remaining material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Because of these remaining material weaknesses, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria outlined in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).\n We continued to implement new procedures and controls in 2020 and have taken steps to remediate the material weaknesses at the entity and activity levels, and to review further our procedures and controls in 2021. In addition, we expect to make additional changes to our infrastructure, personnel and related processes that we believe are also reasonably likely to strengthen and materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n Prior to the complete remediation of these material weaknesses, there remains risk that the processes and procedures on which we currently rely will fail to be sufficiently effective, which could result in material misstatement of our financial position or results of operations and require a restatement. Moreover, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls even where we conclude the controls are operating effectively can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, including instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, our control systems, as we develop them, may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected and could be material to our financial statements.\n The certifications of our principal executive officer/principal financial officer required in accordance with Rule 13a-14(a) under the Exchange Act and Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Controls and Procedures\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company's management, including the interim Chief Executive Officer /Chief Financial Officer of the Company, as its principal financial officer has evaluated the effectiveness of the Company's \u201cdisclosure controls and procedures,\u201d as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). Based upon this evaluation, the interim Chief Executive Officer/Chief Financial Officer has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective, due to material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, for the purpose of ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports that the Company files or submits under the Exchange Act with the Securities and Exchange Commission is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time period specified by the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and forms, and is accumulated and communicated to the Company's management, including its principal executive/financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\n As described in our accompanying Management's Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, we have identified four remaining material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting. Because of these remaining material weaknesses, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective based on the criteria outlined in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\u201cCOSO\u201d).\n We continued to implement new procedures and controls in 2020 and have taken steps to remediate the material weaknesses at the entity and activity levels, and to review further our procedures and controls in 2021. In addition, we expect to make additional changes to our infrastructure, personnel and related processes that we believe are also reasonably likely to strengthen and materially affect our internal control over financial reporting.\n Prior to the complete remediation of these material weaknesses, there remains risk that the processes and procedures on which we currently rely will fail to be sufficiently effective, which could result in material misstatement of our financial position or results of operations and require a restatement. Moreover, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls even where we conclude the controls are operating effectively can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, including instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the controls. The design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Over time, our control systems, as we develop them, may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected and could be material to our financial statements.\n The certifications of our principal executive officer/principal financial officer required in accordance with Rule 13a-14(a) under the Exchange Act and Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are attached as exhibits to this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The disclosures set forth in this Item 9A contain information concerning (i) the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures, and changes in internal control over financial reporting, referred to in paragraph 4 of the certifications, and (ii) material weaknesses in the design or operation of our internal control over financial reporting, referred to in paragraph 5 of the certifications.

We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n Critical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n Liquidity Assessment\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nManagement has prepared the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements on a going concern basis, which contemplates the continuity of operations, and the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. As discussed in Note 2, the Company incurred an operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, but had positive working capital as of December 31, 2020 and net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020. Management assesses whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund its costs for the next twelve months from the financial statement issuance date in order to determine if there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern. In the preparation of this liquidity assessment, management applies judgment to estimate the projected cash flows of the Company, which are based on known or planned cash requirements for operating costs as well as planned costs for project development.\n The principal consideration for our determination that performing procedures relating to the liquidity assessment is a critical audit matter is the significant judgments made by management when assessing whether the Company has sufficient liquidity. We determined there is significant estimation and execution uncertainty regarding the Company\u2019s future cash flows and the risk of bias in management\u2019s judgments and assumptions in estimating these cash flows.\n How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company\u2019s assertion as to its ability to continue as a going concern included the following, among others:\n\u25cf\nWe gained an understanding of the Company\u2019s process relating to the preparation of projected information and considerations of the Company\u2019s obligations.\n \u25cf\nWe tested the reasonableness of the projected operating expenses, and uses and sources of cash used in management\u2019s assessment of whether the Company has sufficient liquidity to fund operations for at least one year from the financial statement issuance date."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_809", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "\u25cf\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management\u2019s assumptions related to the likelihood that the Company would be able to reduce operating expenditures if required.\n KMJ Corbin & Company LLP\nWe have served as the Company\u2019s auditor since 2013.\n Irvine, California\nMarch 31, 2021\nPAID, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAS OF DECEMBER 31,\nASSETS\nCurrent assets:\nCash and cash equivalents\n$1,644,210\n$475,881\nAccounts receivable, net\n171,785\n131,561\nPrepaid expenses and other current assets\n184,366\n124,257\nTotal current assets\n2,000,361\n731,699\nProperty and equipment, net\n59,848\n89,707\nIntangible assets, net\n3,633,420\n4,048,572\nOperating lease right-of-use assets\n93,457\n121,440\nTotal assets\n$5,787,086\n$4,991,418\nLIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCurrent liabilities:\nAccounts payable\n$1,460,484\n$876,260\nFinance leases -

The Company indemnifies its directors, officers, employees and agents, as permitted under the laws of the State of Delaware. In connection with its facility lease, the Company has agreed to indemnify its lessor for certain claims arising from the use of the facilities. The duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies, and is generally tied to the life of the agreement. These guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments the Company could be obligated to make.
