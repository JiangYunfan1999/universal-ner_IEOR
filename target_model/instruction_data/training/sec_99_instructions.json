While Eli Attia was teaching his invention at Google [x], the project was internally valued by Google at $120 Billion USD a year in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction industry to which Attia has been a leader for half a century.\n The Racketeering (RICO) version of the case has been spearheaded by John E. Floyd, the leading authority on RICO in all fifty states and the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of G. Robert Blakey, the creator of the original RICO statute and the co-author of the Attia\u2019s initial RICO suit against Google and the founders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin as well as Google X CEO Astro Teller, Sebastian Thrun, and Flux Factory with its falsely claimed co-inventors Nicholas Chim, Jennifer Carlile, Michelle Kaufmann, Augusto Roman and Astro Teller. In the appealed RICO opening brief, Floyd makes the following points as part of his argument -\n\u201cThe district court misapplied the law in each of its rulings. The court\u2019s statutory standing finding was premised on an unduly restrictive reading of the DTSA and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1832 that actually protects-indeed, rewards-the most egregious trade secret mis-appropriators - those who, like Google, steal and then extinguish trade secrets altogether by wrongfully publishing them."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_15", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "And in any event, Google and Flux are equitably estopped from invoking Google\u2019s wrongful publication of Plaintiffs\u2019 trade secrets to evade liability under either the DTSA or RICO.\u201d\n In October 2019, the Federal Circuit ruled that the Inter Partes Review (IPR) Judges at the Patent Trademark and Appeals Board (PTAB) were not qualified under the United States Constitution, so therefore Googles impairment of the \u2018339 ODT Patent was illegal in the process Max Sound\u2019s Chairman Halpern has been calling \u201ccriminal theft of legitimate American Small Business Inventors under the license for big Corporations to steal known as America Invents Act.\u201d\n To further clarify MAXD\u2019s current role in the Attia and ODT legal matters described above, the Company is not a party to any of these legal cases that it has an interest in and the potential to profit from in the future.

Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential of shares of common stock outstanding during the period including stock options or warrants, using the treasury stock method (by using the average stock price for the period to determine the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants), and convertible debt or convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential of shares of common stock if their effect is anti-dilutive.

Such action would require shareholder approval. Until such time as the Company has a sufficient number of shares of its Common Stock for issuance to cover the Potentially Issuable Shares, the Company could be subject to penalties and damages to the holders of the Convertible Instruments in the event it does not deliver the Potentially Issuable Shares upon request by a holder of the Convertible Instruments.
