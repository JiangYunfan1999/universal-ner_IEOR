Risk Factors\nWhile we expect the impacts of COVID-19 to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, we are unable to predict the extent or nature of these impacts at this time.\n Due to the COVID-19 pandemic we have been unable to: (i) conduct face-to-face meetings with customers and prospective customers, (ii) present in-person demonstrations of our software solutions, (iii) attend trade shows and conferences which typically generate future sales opportunities or (iv) meet with prospective strategic partners. These effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted our operating and financial results in 2020 and will likely have an adverse impact on our operating and financial results over the next several quarters.\n The extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic will depend on various factors and consequences beyond our control, such as the duration and scope of the pandemic; additional actions by businesses and governments in response to the pandemic; and the speed and effectiveness of responses to combat the virus, including vaccine development and distribution. COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.\nOur operating results may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period and are difficult to predict.\n Individual orders can represent a meaningful percentage of our revenues and operating results in any single quarter and the timing of the receipt of those orders is difficult to predict.

Financing activity cash usage was primarily the result of $0.8 million used to buy back stock under our stock repurchase program and $0.1 million used to pay income taxes for employees who surrendered shares in connection with stock grants.\n At December 31, 2020, we had cash and cash equivalents of $38.6 million. While we cannot assure you that we will not require additional financing, or that if needed such financing will be available to us, we believe that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months from the filing date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTo date, inflation has not had a material impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance, however, that inflation will not adversely affect our financial results in the future.\n OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS\nWe do not currently have any arrangements with unconsolidated entities, such as entities often referred to as structured finance, special purpose entities, or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes."}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_473", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe Company\u2019s significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report.

The core principle of Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cASC\u201d) Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (\u201cASC 606\u201d) is that we should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. To achieve that core principle, we should apply the following five step model:\n1) Identify the contract with the customer\nA contract with a customer exists when (i) we enter into an enforceable contract with a customer that defines each party\u2019s rights regarding the goods or services to be transferred and identifies the related payment terms, (ii) the contract has commercial substance, and (iii) we determine that collection of substantially all consideration for goods and services that are transferred is probable based on the customer\u2019s intent and ability to pay the promised consideration. We apply judgment in determining the customer\u2019s intent and ability to pay, which is based on a variety of factors including the customer\u2019s historical payment experience, or in the case of a new customer, published credit and financial information pertaining to the customer.\n We evaluate contract modifications for the impact on revenue recognition if they have been approved by both parties such that the enforceable rights and obligations under the contract have changed. Contract modifications are either accounted for using a cumulative effect adjustment or prospectively over the remaining term of the arrangement.

If two or more contracts are combined, the consideration to be paid is aggregated and allocated to the individual performance obligations without regard to the consideration specified in the individual contracts.\n 2) Identify the performance obligations in the contract\nPerformance obligations promised in a contract are identified based on the goods and services that will be transferred to the customer that are both capable of being distinct, whereby the customer can benefit from the\ngood or service either on its own or together with other available resources, and are distinct in the context of the contract, whereby the transfer of the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.

We establish a valuation allowance to offset temporary deductible differences, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits when it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the tax position. The evaluation of an uncertain tax position is based on factors that include, but are not limited to, changes in the tax law, the measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in tax returns, the effective settlement of matters subject to audit, and changes in facts or circumstances related to a tax position. Any changes to these estimates, based on the actual results obtained and/or a change in assumptions, could impact our tax provision in future periods. Interest and penalty charges, if any, related to unrecognized tax benefits would be classified as a provision for income tax in the consolidated statements of operations.\n Capitalization of Software Costs - We capitalize certain internally developed software development costs after technological feasibility of the product has been established. No software costs were capitalized during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, because such costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility, but prior to commercial availability, were immaterial.\n Research and Development Costs - Costs incurred in the research and development of our products are expensed as incurred.\n Concentration of Credit Risk - At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash and cash equivalents, in excess of federally insured deposit limits of approximately $38.3 million and $47.5 million, respectively.\nConcentration of credit risk with respect to net accounts receivable and unbilled receivables consisted of amounts owed by the following customers that comprised more than 10% of net accounts receivable and unbilled receivables at December 31:\nCustomer A\n%\n%\nCustomer B\n%\n-\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes metric in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_748", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "Year ended\nDecember 31,\nCustomer A\n%\n%\nStock-Based Compensation - We grant stock and stock options to our employees and directors.
