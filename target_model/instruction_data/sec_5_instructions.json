Each of these options for capital will be compared to one another on a regular basis, and capital will be deployed according to our management\u2019s judgment as to where it believes allocated capital has the potential to achieve the best long-term return.\n Investment Strategy\n We will seek to focus on acquiring operating businesses and securities that (a) can be purchased at what we believe to be a fair price relative to intrinsic value, (b) are managed by competent and incentivized management teams, (c) offer reasonable downside protection and (d) directly contribute to the Company\u2019s strategic goals. Over time, we believe that a focus on these objectives should allow us to consistently deliver targeted investment returns that outperforms the broader market. We plan to target investments into businesses that we believe (i) operate in industries with stable long-term operating profiles, (ii) present a stable unlevered free cash flow profile, (iii) have the ability to quickly adapt to changing economic cycles and (iv) face minimal threats of technological or competitive obsolescence.\n We believe that an investment strategy focused on investments with these character traits coupled with a value investing orientation should continue to present attractive investment opportunities that allow us to build a less correlated portfolio of operating assets that provide shareholders with exposure to a mix of growth and acyclical operating assets that allow us to maximize shareholder value.\n Management Strategy\n Our management strategy involves the financial and operational management of the businesses that we anticipate acquiring in a manner that seeks to grow earnings and cash flow and, in turn increasing stockholder value. In general, we plan to oversee and support the management team of each of our businesses by, among other things:\n\u25cf recruiting and retaining talented managers to operate our businesses by using structured incentive compensation programs, including minority equity ownership, tailored to each business;\n\u25cf regularly monitoring financial and operational performance, instilling consistent financial discipline, and supporting management in the development and implementation of information systems to effectively achieve these goals:\n\u25cf assisting management in their analysis and pursuit of prudent organic growth strategies:\n\u25cf identifying and working with management to execute on attractive external growth and acquisition opportunities; and\n\u25cf forming strong subsidiary level boards of directors to supplement management in their development and implementation of strategic goals and objectives\nOur investment strategy centers around our ability to consistently seek to acquire securities and/or companies at a discount to intrinsic value as determined by various metrics, including without limitation, replacement cost, break-up value, cash flow and earnings power and liquidation value.\n We utilize a process-oriented, research-intensive, value-based investing approach.

We intend to make investments in businesses that we believe are undervalued and have potential for growth. We will also seek to capitalize on investment opportunities arising from market inefficiencies, economic or market trends that have not been identified and reflected in market value, or complex or special situations. Certain opportunities may arise from companies/assets that experience busted sell-side auction processes, disappointing financial results, liquidity or capital needs, lowered credit ratings, revised industry forecasts or legal complications. We may acquire businesses or assets directly or we may establish an ownership position through the purchase of debt or equity securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.\n \u25cf Utilize a Low-Cost Model. We believe our low overhead model will allow us to more effectively utilize excess cash flows from our portfolio of operating businesses and securities to enhance stockholder through efficient capital allocation activities.\n \u25cf Internal Resources and External Network Sufficient to Drive Accretive Opportunities. We believe our internal management team and their strong relationships with industry executives, accountants, attorneys, business brokers, commercial and investment bankers, and other potential sources of acquisition opportunities offer us a strong pipeline of opportunities. Additionally, the flexibility, creativity, experience and expertise of our management team in structuring transactions allows us to consider non-traditional and complex transactions tailored to fit a specific acquisition target.\n \u25cf Drive Accountability and Financial Discipline in the Management of our Business.

The Company currently cannot predict when the Company will become revenue producing.\n Operating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for 2020 increased by $1,722,609, compared to 2019, mainly as a result of an increase in general and administrative, expenses incurred in connection with the Company\u2019s decision to broaden its business strategy.\n Other Expenses\nOther expenses for 2020 increased by $2,002,455 compared to 2019 as a result of the valuation of certain derivative warrants and notes, together with a material increase in the interest expense.\n Net Profit (Loss)\n The net loss for 2020 was ($4,124,783), a decrease of $4,347,622 compared to a net profit in 2019 of $222,839, as a result of an increase in other expenses and total operating expenses as a result of an increase in general administrative expenses.\n Liquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity is the ability of an enterprise to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for cash requirements. As of December 31, 2020, our working capital deficit amounted to $3,783,009 a decrease of $778,181 as compared to $14,067 as of December 31, 2019. This decrease is primarily a result of a increase in accounts payable, partially offset by an increase in related party liabilities, notes payable and derivative liabilities and current assets.\n Net cash used in operating activities was ($1,116,865) during 2020 compared to ($3,865,334) in 2019. The increase in cash used in operating activities is primarily attributable to our operating performance going from a net profit of $222,839 in fiscal 2019 to ($4,124,783) in fiscal 2020 coupled with the Company entering into certain derivative warrant and note transactions.\n"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "I've read this text."}, {"from": "human", "value": "What describes organization in the text?"}, {"from": "gpt", "value": "[]"}]}, {"id": "NER_250", "conversations": [{"from": "human", "value": "ITEM 7.

The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset may be impaired.\n The accounting guidance provides the Company with the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. At December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an impairment for the goodwill relating to the discontinued operations. Refer to Note 9.\nIntangible assets\nIntellectual property, customer contracts and tradenames that were acquired by the Company from a third party are capitalized and subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, if they have finite useful lives, they are for approved products or if there are alternative future uses. Amortization is calculated over the cost of the intangible asset less its residual value. Amortization is recognized in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets from the date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits embodied in the asset.
